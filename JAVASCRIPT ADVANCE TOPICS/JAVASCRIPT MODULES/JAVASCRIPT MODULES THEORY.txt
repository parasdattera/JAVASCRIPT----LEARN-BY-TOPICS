Modules are nothing but JavaScript files having functions , variables , codes that can be reused when needed in other files

exports keyword is used to make code from one file able to be get imported to another file

and import keyword is used to import the module 


Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections; good programmers divide their programs into modules.

Like a book chapter, modules are just clusters of code


Module pattern --
The Module pattern is used to mimic the concept of classes (since JavaScript doesn’t natively support classes) so that we can store both public and private methods and variables inside a single object — similar to how classes are used in other programming languages like Java or Python. That allows us to create a public facing API for the methods that we want to expose to the world, while still encapsulating private variables and methods in a closure scope.
