Events allow you to write JavaScript code that reacts to certain situations. Examples of
events include:

• The user clicks the mouse button
• The Web page loading
• A form field being changed

As of today, there are 2 ways to handle events in JavaScript.

I.By using an event handler -- JavaScript provides various kinds of

                                based on specific actions on the HTML
                                elements. Few of the event handlers are:

                                onclick , onload , onmouseover , onmouseout , onkeypress , onkeydown , onkeyup
